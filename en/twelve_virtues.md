# Y15A's Twelve Personal Virtues


## Overarching Vision

These are the three personal qualities I strive to embody:

1. **Stoic:** Remain calm and composed. Respond thoughtfully and with intention, without reacting emotionally to unpleasant events or people.
2. **Principled:** Consistently uphold high moral standards, perform my duties with diligence, and hold myself accountable.
3. **Compassionate:** While adhering to my principles, I am understanding and forgiving of those who may follow a different path.

My goal is to blend strength, integrity, and empathy in my character. To achieve this vision, I commit to these twelve virtues in every moment of my life.

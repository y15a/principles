# X.com Manifesto

## Focus Areas

I will tweet about startups, business, software, and parenthood, showcasing both professional insights and personal experiences.

## Language Strategy

I will post in both Japanese and English:

 - English: Global content on startups and software.
 - Japanese: Local business and Japan-specific topics.
 - Bilingual: When relevant to both audiences.

## Content Balance

 - 40% Original Posts: Share insights, blog links, or lessons learned.
 - 40% Replies: Engage meaningfully with influencers and followers.
 - 20% Reposts: Amplify valuable content from others, adding my take.

## Hashtag Usage

I will use 1-3 relevant hashtags per tweet, combining broad and niche tags, in both languages.

## Engagement with Influencers

I will add unique value, reply early, and avoid generic comments.
I will focus on contributing thoughtfully to discussions while avoiding sarcasm or snark.

## Personal/Private Content

I will share personal stories that align with my professional brand (startups, parenthood, etc.).
Personal posts will make up 10-20% of my total output, ensuring relevance and avoiding oversharing.

## Cynicism Check

I will be mindful of my tone, focusing on constructive dialogue over cynicism or sarcasm.
efore posting, I will ensure my tone adds value and fits my brand.

## Consistency

I will engage with X daily, balancing posts, replies, and reposts. I will track engagement and adjust based on response.

## Long-term Goal

Visibility first, followed by building meaningful connections in my niche communities.

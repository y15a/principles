# Temperance

The aim is to nourish my body and mind for peak performance daily and lifelong.

## Drinking

1. Avoid alcohol entirely.
2. Opt for tea (black or green) if caffeine is needed; coffee tends to make me jittery and can be addictive.
3. Steer clear of sugary drinks.
4. Stay well-hydrated with water.

## Eating

1. Keep daily carbohydrate intake under 130g, with 30-50g per meal.
2. Refrain from eating solid food after 8 p.m.
3. Include at least 1 cup (200 ml) of vegetables per meal.
4. Limit red meat to two servings per week, substituting with poultry, fish, and plant-based proteins and fats.
5. Consume carbohydrates last during each meal.
